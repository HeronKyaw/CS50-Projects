This is the google project of CS50W.
I made it as nearly exactly as the real Google but it might lack of some features. <br>
Anyway, I created these website pages using <img width ='32px' height = "25px" src ='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rahulbanerjee26/githubAboutMeGenerator/main/icons/html.svg'>, <img width ='32px' height = "25px" src ='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rahulbanerjee26/githubAboutMeGenerator/main/icons/css.svg'>, <strong>and<strong>, <img width ='32px' height = "25px" src ='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rahulbanerjee26/githubAboutMeGenerator/main/icons/bootstrap.svg'>.
